My approach to programming languages used in the Cultural Heritage Ecosystem is rooted importantly to the ways that the human can make programs speak to each other and in essence stack them along pipelines. Is not a single program but a number of them, it is not one programming language but a number of them each one with its own functionality, it is not one system for all but an ecosystem of family tools and processes that provide fuels to the Cultural Heritage vehicle.

As a trained Linguist in my Digital Humanities endeavour I am intrigued by the software-theoretical analogue to Sapir's and Whorf's observation of linguistic relativity: that how the speaker of a language conceives the world is shaped by that language.
