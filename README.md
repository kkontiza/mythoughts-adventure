My approach to programming languages used in the Cultural Heritage Ecosystem is rooted importantly to the ways that the human can make programs speak to each other and in essence stack them along pipelines. Is not a single program but a number of them, it is not one programming language but a number of them each one with its own functionality, it is not one system for all but an ecosystem of family tools and processes that provide fuels to the Cultural Heritage vehicle.

As a trained Linguist in my Digital Humanities endeavour I am intrigued by the software-theoretical analogue to Sapir's and Whorf's observation of linguistic relativity: that how the speaker of a language conceives the world is shaped by that language.

I am interested in exploring how digital humanities approaches and methods can interrogate both soft (human-qualitative) data and numbers to answer research questions and how technology (-ies) and Cultural Heritage standards can provide tools for researchers to facilitate the discovery and study of data patterns and recovery of information, that remains scattered and unexplored across physical or digital databases.

I would highlight as my strong research skills my ability to investigate, clean, manipulate, interrogate and meaningfully visualise data. Both the academic and the professional - museum- environments, where I have been developing these skills required detailed analysis of
information, self-reflective synthesis of information from different sources and adaptation of research results presentation to engage the intended audience, and allowed me in the last five years to grow into a self motivated, independent researcher.
